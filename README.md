# SIEM-Implementation-and-Log-Analysis

## Objective

To showcase the deployment and configuration of an Elastic Stack SIEM integrated with a Kali Linux virtual machine, focusing on real-time threat detection and enhanced incident response capabilities. This project highlights the implementation of Elastic Defend agents and custom alerting mechanisms for detecting network scans, particularly Nmap, along with the development of interactive Kibana dashboards for improved monitoring, threat detection, and vulnerability assessment. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in SIEM setup, advanced monitoring techniques, and security event analysis through visualizations and tailored alerts.

### Skills Learned

- Expertise in deploying and configuring the Elastic Stack SIEM for comprehensive security monitoring.
- Proficiency in integrating Elastic Defend agents and developing custom alerts for real-time threat detection, including Nmap scans.
- Advanced skills in designing and creating interactive Kibana dashboards and visualizations for enhanced security event analysis.
- In-depth understanding of incident response workflows and techniques for improving detection and mitigation efficiency.
- Ability to analyze and interpret security data to identify potential vulnerabilities and enhance overall system defenses.

### Tools Used

- Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for SIEM deployment, log ingestion, and analysis.
- Elastic Defend agents for endpoint monitoring and custom alert creation.
- Kali Linux VM for network scanning and testing in a controlled environment.
- Nmap for generating network scan traffic and testing detection capabilities.
- Kibana for designing interactive dashboards and visualizations for real-time security monitoring..
